        "A few notes:\n",
        "- Downloading ImageNet should take about 7 minutues. Extracting should take another 7 minutes. So run this code, then go have a coffee or whatever.\n",
        "- The data will be removed after 24 hours or so. That's just how Colab works. Each time you reset the environment, you will also have to redownload ImageNet. \n",
        "    - I would recommend against storing it on your on Google Drive though as that is way slower to read during training.\n",
        "    - Through extensive testing, we have found that the fastest way to get the data is the code we provide (faster than saving to google drive, uploading by hand, etc.) \n",
        "- Reading images directly with PIL seems to have issues on Colab. Instead try cv2.imread.\n",
        "    - cv2.imread returns images in bgr order. To go from bgr -> rgb, use    `im = im[:, :, ::-1]`\n",
        "- The images are provided such that the minimum side length is at least 128 unless the original image was too small for it to be shrunk.\n",
        "    - transforms.Resize will be your friend\n",
        "- It seams you cannot use a batch size > 64 x 128 x 128 x 3 while still using multiprocessing due to Colab limitations. You can use larger batches if you set num_workers = 0, but it will be much slower.\n",
        "- This dataset has 1000 classes, whereas Tiny ImageNet only had 200.\n",
        "- You will probably want to save your results more than once every epoch since Colab may spurriously shut down your session.\n",
        "- We know this takes a long time to run. Try leaving it overnight. We don't expect you to get state-of-the-art performance.\n",
        "- `glob.glob` is a good Python function for reading lots of folder/file names, but it does not return a sorted list.\n",
